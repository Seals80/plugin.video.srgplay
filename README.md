**SRG Play TV** (plugin.video.srgplay) is a Kodi plugin to access the video library of the Swiss Radio and Television (SRG SSR).

## Goals of the plugin
Bring the full power of the [SRG SSR Play TV media library](https://www.srgssr.ch) on your TV (or another device) via [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). The plugin aims to be close to the original media library, so that the experience of consuming media through the browser or through Kodi should be similar.

## Features
 - [x] Overview over all the shows.
 - [x] Manage a list of your favourite SRG SSR shows and get a list of your recently aired favourite shows.
 - [x] List and play segments for shows (if available), so you don't have to watch the whole episode if you are only interested in a specific section.
 - [x] Various lists: Newest and most clicked shows by topic (e.g. News, Documentaries, etc.), trending shows, soon offline shows, shows by date. 
 - [x] Choose between SD and HD quality.
 - [x] Subtitle support.
 - [x] Livestreams that are exclusively broadcasted on SRG SSR Business Unit (only available in Switzerland).
 - [x] Live TV support: LA1, LA2, SRF1, SRF2 and SRF info, RTS (only available in Switzerland).

## Planned features
 - [ ] Twitter integration: For shows with a SRG SSR hashtag (e.g. #srfarena) get the tweets which were emitted during the show on the screen.
 - [ ] Download episodes for personal archiving purposes (probably through an additional Kodi script).
